Run server with

```
cd server/
```

```
source setup.sh
```

If it doesn't work, install packages in requirements.txt with conda install --file requirements and pip install -r requirements.txt.

Then run...

```
source activate.sh
```

Run the frontend canvas using a local server (VS code has an extension for this). Ensure, it's in a seperate window so file overwrites in the same root directory don't cause a crash.
